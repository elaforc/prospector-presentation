# Testing

Once I got it working, I wanted to know that my bot could at least consistently beat the random bot they provide (random meaning it just arbitrarily chooses a new cell to move too.). I wrote a simple test framework to run the bot 100 times against and opponent and tracked the average halite collected vs the opponent.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
command="../halite_nix --no-replay --no-logs -vvv --width 32 --height 32 'node ../SeamCarvingBot.js' 'node ../archive/MyBot.js' 2>&1"
OUTPUT=$(eval "$command")

ids=$(echo "$OUTPUT" | awk '/was rank [0-9]+ with [0-9]* halite/ {print $3;}' | cut -d , -f1)
names=$(echo "$OUTPUT" | awk '/was rank [0-9]+ with [0-9]* halite/ {print $4;}' | cut -d , -f1)
scores=$(echo "$OUTPUT" | awk '/was rank [0-9]+ with [0-9]* halite/ {print $9;}')

IDS=($ids)
NAMES=($names)
SCORES=($scores)

FIRST_PLAYER=()
FIRST_PLAYER+=(${SCORES[0]})
SECOND_PLAYER=()
SECOND_PLAYER+=(${SCORES[1]})

for i in {1..99}
do
  OUTPUT=$(eval "$command")
  scores=$(echo "$OUTPUT" | awk '/was rank [0-9]+ with [0-9]* halite/ {print $9;}')
  SCORES=($scores)
  FIRST_PLAYER+=(${SCORES[0]})
  SECOND_PLAYER+=(${SCORES[1]})
done

declare -i FIRST_PLAYER_SUM
declare -i SECOND_PLAYER_SUM

for i in {0..99}
do
  FIRST_PLAYER_SUM+=FIRST_PLAYER[i]
  SECOND_PLAYER_SUM+=SECOND_PLAYER[i]
done

FIRST_PLAYER_AVG=$(($FIRST_PLAYER_SUM/100))
SECOND_PLAYER_AVG=$(($SECOND_PLAYER_SUM/100))

echo "The first player ${NAMES[0]} has an average score of ${FIRST_PLAYER_AVG} over 100 runs"
echo "The second player ${NAMES[1]} has an average score of ${SECOND_PLAYER_AVG} over 100 runs"
```

Additionally I wanted to tune my bot to work as well as possible. I moved all my magic numbers to a constants file

```javascript
module.exports = {
    /**
     * Number of seams to select from when choosing a path
     * The larger the number, the more random the possibilities
     */
    NUMBER_OF_SEAMS: 5,
    /**
     * The size of grid to seach for maximum seams
     * The larger the size, the farther away from the
     * shipyard a ship must go to find energy
     */
    SEARCH_AREA: 8,
    /**
     * What percentage of the game to stop building
     * entities. After this percentage is hit the 
     * game will just focus on collecting halite with
     * the entities it has.
     */
    STOP_BUILDING_TURN: 75,
    /**
     * The turn number to start considering
     * building a dropoff. If built too soon the dropoff
     * will likely be really close to the shipyard
     */
    START_DROPOFF_TURN: 20,
    /**
     * Maximum number of dropoffs to build
     */
    MAXIMUM_NUM_DROPOFFS: 1,
    /**
     * What percentage of maximum capacity should a ship
     * go back to drop off halite
     */
    RETREAT_PERCENTAGE: 80,
    /**
     * What percentage of halite remaining should a ship
     * decide to move on to another cell in the map
     */
    GET_MOVING_PERCENTAGE: 10,
    /**
     * What percentage of the time should a ship choose
     * a random direction instead of trying to follow the 
     * seam. This is important otherwise every ship is trying
     * to do the same thing.
     */
    ENTROPY: 5,
    /**
     * Number of ships to build before focusing on gathering
     * halite
     */
    NUMBER_OF_SHIPS: 7
};
```

> This constants file in conjunction with my test script would allow me to test different settings and see how well my bot improved (or didn't improve). For example what if I built 10 ships instead of 7?.
